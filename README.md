# FlipCoin

This JavaScript code provides users with a simple coin tossing simulation.

How does it work?

1. User clicks the "Flip" button.

2. JavaScript tosses the coin (heads or tails) by generating a random number.

3. Coin animations are played according to the result of the throw.

4. After each shot, the "Heads" and "Tails" numbers are updated and displayed to the user.

5. During shooting, the "Flip" button is disabled for 3 seconds so that the user does not accidentally click more than once.

6. By clicking the "Reset" button, the user can reset the statistics and start a new coin flipping experience.
